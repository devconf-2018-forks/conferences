OVERVIEW
--------

Another example of STM and Vert.x integration. The quickstart is divided into 3 parts each introducing
a different facet of STM and Vert.x integration.

Use Case 1 shows a single JVM running multiple vertx instances sharing the same volatile STM object.

Use Case 2 uses the same STM object but makes it persistent and shows how to share it across address
spaces.

These two examples illustrate the different ways in which an application can be scaled whilst
maintaining data consistency:

 - verticle scaling by using better hardware so that more threads can do be used to service the
   workload;
 - horizontal scaling by using more servers so that the workload can be distributed to multiple JVMs

Use case 3 shows a single JVM hosting multiple STM objects and a Trip verticle which listens for
trip, theatre and taxi booking requests. STM is used manage concurrent access to the various STM
objects.

Use case 4 is an optional final stress test to check that STM correctly manages concurrent access
to STM objects.

First build a fat jar that contains all the classes needed to run both demos in a single jar:

  mvn clean package

Use Case 1: Scaling by adding more threads
==========================================

Characteristics:

  - RECOVERABLE and EXCLUSIVE
  - creates multiple vertx instances each instance using a handle to the same STM object
  
What it's good for:

  - vertical scaling where adding better h/w is an option in order to support more threads in one JVM

Features:

This example shows a Theatre booking service:
   - an STM object is used to maintain all Theatre bookings
     * the STM object is volatile
   - multiple vertx instances each listening on the same HTTP endpoint
   - each vertx instance shares the same STM object
   - all vertx instances run in the same address space
     * concurrency is managed by the STM runtime
   - shows vertical scaling

Usage:
------

  mvn exec:java -Pdemo1

or

  java -cp target/stm-vertx-demo-5.6.0.Final-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar demo.demo12.VolatileTheatreVerticle 

This command starts the 10 instances of the theatre verticle which all listen for requests/messages on
HTTP port 8080. The port and number of instances are configurable. If run the example directly from the
java command line notice that the version of the jar (5.6.0.Final-SNAPSHOT in this example) will change
depending upon which narayana release you have.

Create 2 bookings:

First booking execute:

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/theatre/Apollo

Expected output should look similar to:

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-3",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 1,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

Second booking execute:

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/theatre/Savoy

Expected output should look similar to:

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-2",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 2,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

Observe how each request is serviced on a different verticle instance

Similarly performing GETs will show the same booking counts regardless of which verticle services it:

  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/theatre 
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/theatre 

Where you should see something similar to the following two outcomes:

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-9",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 2,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

and

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-8",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 2,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

At this point we are finished with the first use case and you can kill the running process.

Use Case 2: Scaling by distributing the workload across JVMs
==========================================

Similar to use case 1 but uses persistent STM objects spread across different JVMs.

Characteristics:

  - PERSISTENT and SHARED
  - theatre service verticles running in different JVMs sharing the same STM object
  - each JVM hosting multiple vertx instances each instance using a handle to the same STM object

What it's good for:

  - horizontal scaling by using better hardware so that more threads can do be used to service the
    workload;

Usage:
------

  mvn exec:java -Pdemo2

or

  java -cp target/stm-vertx-demo-5.6.0.Final-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar demo.demo12.PersistentSharedTheatreVerticle

Start a second verticle that will share the same STM object. In the output of the above command
look for the line that reports the uid of the STM object, for example:

> Theatre STM uid: 0:ffffac1182c6:9197:5912d4ff:1

The actual uid may change from run to run. Pass this uid the second JVM using a java system property:

  mvn exec:java -Pdemo2 -Duid=0:ffffac1182c6:9197:5912d4ff:1

or

  java -cp target/stm-vertx-demo-5.6.0.Final-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar demo.demo12.PersistentSharedTheatreVerticle 0:ffffac1182c6:9197:5912d4ff:1

Create two bookings using services running in the two different JVMs (on endpoints 8080 and 8082
respectively):

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/theatre/Apollo

which should give ouput like:

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-0",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 1,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

and then:

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/theatre/Savoy

which should give output similar to:

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-5",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 2,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

Check that each JVM reports the correct number of bookings (namely 2):

  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/theatre
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8082/api/theatre

And you should see the following outputs:

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-1",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 2,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

and

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-8",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 2,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

At this stage you can kill both running processes before moving on to the next Use Case.

Use Case 3: Managing shared state across different STM objects
===============================================

Characteristics:
  - RECOVERABLE and EXCLUSIVE
  - trip service verticle (multiple instances) using STM objects to maintain theatre and taxi bookings.
  - providing HTTP endpoints for making trip, theatre and taxi bookings.

What it's good for:
  - composing transactional operations across different STM objects 

The trip service fulfils booking requests by updating shared STM objects representing the theatre and
taxi booking services respectively.

  mvn exec:java -Pdemo3

or

  java -cp target/stm-vertx-demo-5.6.0.Final-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar demo.demo3.TripSTMVerticle

Make two trip bookings:

First execute:

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/trip/Savoy/ABC

to obtain:

{
  "serviceName" : "trip",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-8",
  "message" : "1 bookings with alt taxi service",
  "bookingCount" : 1,
  "altBookingCount" : 1
}

Then execute:

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/trip/Apollo/XYZ

to get:

{
  "serviceName" : "trip",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-0",
  "message" : "2 bookings with alt taxi service",
  "bookingCount" : 2,
  "altBookingCount" : 2
}

and a single theatre booking:

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/theatre/Savoy

giving the following output:

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-9",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 3,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

observe that each booking is serviced by a different verticle. Check that number of theatre (3) and
number of taxi (2) bookings are correct:

  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/theatre
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/taxi

Which will give the following outputs:

{
  "serviceName" : "theatre",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-5",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 3,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

and

{
  "serviceName" : "taxi",
  "threadId" : "vert.x-eventloop-thread-2",
  "message" : "",
  "bookingCount" : 2,
  "altBookingCount" : 0
}

respectively.

Again, kill the demo process before proceeding to the next use case.

Use Case 4: Stress Testing:
--------------------------

None of the previous use cases demonstrate contention of the STM objects. This next case will start
use case 1 (theatre booking example) and then make lots of concurrent trip bookings and validate that
the expected number of bookings are made.

Usage:
------

Start the theatre service in one window or in the background:

  mvn exec:java -Pdemo1

and now make lots of concurrent bookings:

  mvn exec:java -Pstress

You should see output similar to the folllowing which indicates successful completion:
