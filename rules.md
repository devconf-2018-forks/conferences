We want these presentations and demos to be used widely after their initial showing at whichever conference or workshop is mentioned.
As such we need to ensure that the demos are buildable by novice users wherever possible and there are clear instructions (a script) within each demo directory such that
the individual presenting or live-coding can be sure they are doing it correctly.

Each example directory must follow these rules:

- be as self contained as possible. Clearly there are limits, e.g., if you need an app server simply point to where the correct version
can be found and downloaded or built. However, if there are call-outs to scripts or other things being hosted on personal repos
then they should be included directly within the example code.

- a script that can be followed step by step by the person demonstrating the example. The script should also make it clear what the expected outcome
for each step should be in order that the individual can know it is working correctly.
